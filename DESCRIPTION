Description: Provides tools for processing, analysing, and summarising conflict 
    event datasets. Functions include filtering and aggregating events, for example
    by time periods and countries, simple trend analysis, creating formatted 
    narrative descriptions, and generating automated summaries using 
    Large Language Model APIs. Helps to transform raw event data into structured 
    analyses and human-readable short narratives.
